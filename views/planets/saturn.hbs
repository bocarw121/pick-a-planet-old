            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest
            planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy
            rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet
            to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as
            Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball
            made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Surrounded by more than 60 known
            moons, Saturn is home to some of the most fascinating landscapes in
            our solar system. From the jets of water that spray from Enceladus
            to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich
            source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

          <h2>Size and distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9
            times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn
            would be about as big as a volleyball. From an average distance of
            886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5
            astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit
            (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun
            to Saturn.
          </p>

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on
            Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate
            or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the
            Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756
            Earth days). Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its
            orbit around the Sun, which is similar to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt.
            This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.

          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At
            Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel
            surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by the
            intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic
            hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen—similar to Jupiter's core
            but considerably smaller. It is hard to imagine, but Saturn is the
            only planet in our solar system whose average density is less than
            water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a
            colossal thing existed.

        <section>
          <h2>Formation</h2>
          <p>
            Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5
            billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to
            become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled
            into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the
            sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of
            hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the
            Sun.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>
            As a gas giant, Saturn does not have a true surface. The planet is
            mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft
            would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it would not be able to fly
            through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures
            deep inside the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to
            fly into the planet.

          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet
            streams and storms. The planet is many different shades of yellow,
            brown and grey. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per
            second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region. In
            contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at
            about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second). And the
            pressure—the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater—is so
            powerful it squeezes gas into liquid. Saturn's north pole has an
            interesting atmospheric feature—a six-sided jet stream. This
            hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager
            I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the Cassini
            spacecraft since. Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers)
            across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds
            (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive, rotating storm at
            the center. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in the
            solar system.

          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578
            times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the
            satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the
            region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged
            particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the
            solar wind. Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a
            planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth, these
            charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at
            least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely
            unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a
            combination of particles ejected from Saturn's moons and Saturn's
            magnetic field's rapid rotation rate. But these
            "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From
            the haze-shrouded surface of Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of
            Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the
            Saturn system. Currently Saturn has 53 confirmed moons with 29
            additional provisional moons awaiting confirmation.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Scientists do not expect to find living things currently thriving on
            Mars. Instead, they are looking for signs of life that existed long
            ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
