            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place
            we know of so far that is inhabited by living things. While Earth is
            only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only
            world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just
            slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
            planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

          <h2>Size and distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the
            biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet
            overall. From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million
            kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the
            Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
            distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to
            quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun. It takes about
            eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours.
            It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra
            quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which
            counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent
            with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That
            day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a
            leap year. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with
            respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt
            causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the
            northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the southern
            hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar
            heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct
            solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the
            situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres
            receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core
            at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle and
            crust. The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel
            metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the
            temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees
            Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer
            is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and
            nickel fluids. In between the outer core and crust is the mantle,
            the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is
            about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency
            of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles
            (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean,
            the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from
            the sea floor to the top of the mantle.

          <h2>Formation</h2>
          <p>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
            billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and
            dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow
            terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a
            solid crust.

        <section>
          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>
            Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains and valleys.
            Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and
            oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are
            constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west
            over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth
            of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one
            another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or
            split and separate. Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70
            percent of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5
            miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97 percent of Earth's water.
            Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans.
            Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount
            Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth's longest mountain
            range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic
            oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and
            Himalayas combined.

          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78
            percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such
            as argon, carbon dioxide and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's
            long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from
            much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects
            us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as
            meteors in the night sky before they can strike the surface as
            meteorites.

        <section>
          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to
            a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop
            shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles
            continuously ejected from the Sun.) When charged particles from the
            solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide
            with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air
            molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and
            southern lights. The magnetic field is what causes compass needles
            to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the
            magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the
            magnetic field. The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic
            reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the
            timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic
            reversal does not cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is
            very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But
            when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many
            different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being
            made. And after the switch is completed, they will all point south
            instead of north.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the
            brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways,
            the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It
            stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less
            variable over thousands of years.
