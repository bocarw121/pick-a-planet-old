            Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest
            planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the
            other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are cold, windy
            clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen
            and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
            than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. Jupiter is
            surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but
            unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint
            and made of dust, not ice.

          <h2>Size and distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11
            times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter
            would be about as big as a basketball. From an average distance of
            484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2
            astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit
            (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun
            to Jupiter.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter
            takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate
            or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the
            Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth
            days). Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around
            the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright
            and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.

          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>
            The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun—mostly
            hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and
            temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid.
            This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system—an ocean
            made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths
            perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so
            great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the
            liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation
            is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating
            the planet's powerful magnetic field. It is still unclear if, deeper
            down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a
            thick, super-hot and dense soup. It could be up to 90,032 degrees
            Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down there, made mostly of iron
            and silicate minerals (similar to quartz).

          <h2>Formation</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about
            4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in
            to become this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over
            after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the
            combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact,
            Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow
            massive enough to ignite. About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled
            into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the
            fifth planet from the Sun.

          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>
            As a gas giant, Jupiter does not have a true surface. The planet is
            mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have
            nowhere to land on Jupiter, it would not be able to fly through
            unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside
            the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into
            the planet.

          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and
            spots. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its
            "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers).
            The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle
            layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The
            innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor. The vivid colors
            you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and
            phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet's warmer
            interior. Jupiter's fast rotation—spinning once every 10
            hours—creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark
            belts and bright zones across long stretches. With no solid surface
            to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years.
            Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some
            reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the
            equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide
            as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300
            years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little
            Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin. Scientists do
            not yet know if these ovals and planet-circling bands are shallow or
            deeply rooted to the interior.

          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>
            The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by
            Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million
            miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times
            the diameter or Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped
            tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers)
            behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous
            magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth.
            It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an
            electric charge. Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of
            charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies,
            creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can
            damage spacecraft.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind
            of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 53 confirmed moons and 26
            provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons are
            named after they are confirmed. Jupiter's four largest moons—Io,
            Europa, Ganymede and Callisto—were first observed by the astronomer
            Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope.
            These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and
            they are some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar
            system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
            Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than
            the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a
            small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with
            the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa,
            making it a tempting place to explore.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know
            it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this
            planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
            adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living
            things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.
            Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our
            solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy
            crust, where life could possibly be supported.
