            The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
            Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface
            of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as
            it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as
            seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is
            not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to
            nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the
            fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

          <h2>Size and distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little
            more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a
            nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry. From an
            average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers),
            Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One
            astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
            to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to
            travel from the Sun to Mercury.

        <section>
          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as
            close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43
            million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around
            the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles
            (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet. Mercury
            spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth
            days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit
            around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not
            accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other
            planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and rise again
            from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
            reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar
            day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days—just over two
            years on Mercury. Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2
            degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That
            means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience
            seasons like many other planets do.

          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large
            metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers),
            about 85 percent of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it
            is partly molten, or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to
            Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400
            kilometers (250 miles) thick.

        <section>
          <h2>Formation</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled
            swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the
            Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central
            core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Surface</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's moon, scarred by many
            impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets.
            Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased
            artists, musicians or authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss
            and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey. Very large impact basins, including
            Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff
            (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid
            impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history.
            While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also
            cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high.
            They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the
            billions of years since Mercury formed. Most of Mercury's surface
            would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are
            called "crater rays." They are formed when an asteroid or comet
            strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is
            released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also
            crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of
            this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls
            to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are
            more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The
            space environment—dust impacts and solar-wind particles—causes the
            rays to darken with time. Temperatures on the surface of Mercury are
            extreme, both hot and cold. During the day, temperatures on
            Mercury's surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees
            Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat,
            nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees
            Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius). Mercury may have water ice
            at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in
            regions of permanent shadow. There it could be cold enough to
            preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of
            the planet.

          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up
            of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking
            meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen,
            sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium.

          <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator.
            Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just one percent
            the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the
            solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that
            funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the
            planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally
            charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
            temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are
            most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.
